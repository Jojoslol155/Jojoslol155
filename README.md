## Hello there 👋
I'm Jorge Ata-Quiroz, a game designer and AI enthusiast passionate about the intersection of creativity, technology, and innovation. 
I love exploring how games can engage players through mechanics, world-building, and experiences. 
Whether it’s designing clever gameplay loops, experimenting with procedural content, or making AI NPCs that feel a little too real—I’m all about pushing the boundaries🎱.

🎲 Current Quests:
- 🧠 AI-Powered Game Mechanics – Teaching NPCs to be too smart for their own good (or at least more reactive).
- 🌍 Procedural Worldbuilding – Because handcrafted maps are great, but infinite ones are even better.
- 🤖 Working on a team project - It's always fun to maek new friends.

🚀 Ultimate Goals
- Invent gameplay mechanics that make players go, "Whoa, that’s cool!"
- Combine AI & game design to create games that feel alive and unpredictable.
- Work with a team that thrives on creativity, problem-solving, and a shared love for gaming.

🔥 Side Quests
- Expanding my game dev toolkit with wild experiments.
- Learning how to make AI too good at playing my own games.
- Finding the perfect balance between "starting cool projects" and "actually finishing them.".
